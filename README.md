# Openframeworks-Compute-Shader-ParticleSim-Sample

This is a super small project that will show the basics of creating a bunch of particles and then moving them with a compute shader, then drawing them to the screen. The glsl file (the main computer shader), is found in the bin folder. It is called particle.glsl. This is the main script to edit. OpenGL is also set to render points rather than quads.
